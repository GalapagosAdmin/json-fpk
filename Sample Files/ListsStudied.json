Core List I (English version)","description":"These are the *fundamental 134 basic words* that i collected while preparing for the BJT Business Japanese Proficiency Test (new name of the Jetro Test).\r\n\r\nThe BJT test is very similar to a TOEIC examination, focused on measuring your ability to deal with japanese in work-related situations.\r\n\r\nLike \"TOEIC\":http://www.ets.org/toeic/ you can take the test several times until your skill level (measured by a Score and a Level) is good enough for your needs.\r\n\r\nEven if you never heard about this test, this list is very useful if you plan to improve you chances of working in japan and want to improve quickly your japanese skills for work and business. \r\n\r\nThis is not officially endorsed by \"Jetro\":http://www.jetro.go.jp/ , but a personal word list that i created to help myself memorize more words and improve my BJT score.\r\nIt can help you complement the \"official study material\":http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/bjt/books/jlrt_guide/  and memorize the most common business related words - and the best part, it's all iKnow! ready - so you don't need to create your own from scratch.\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in applying to next BJT examination - if your japanese level is equivalent to the JLPT 2kyu or 1Kyu and you are ready to challenge yourself, then take note of next application deadline, 25th of september, to be able to attend to this year's exam in november.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a long term career in Japan, and you are not an English native speaker - this is my case - you should seriously take in consideration to take both TOEIC and BJT tests once in a while.\r\n\r\nTo know more about the BJT test and the official preparation books go visit the official site:\r\n\r\n\"BJT Business Japanese Proficiency Test -
