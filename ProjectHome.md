This project is a simple JSON decoder for Freepascal/Delphi.  This is useful if you want to use web services to request data from a desktop application, and the data is returned in JSON format.

The aim here is simple procedural use of basic (mostly read-only) functionality.  There are more full featured JSON manipulation libraries already available for Object Pascal, which we recommend you use for any advanced JSON functionality.  There is also a JSON Tree viewer demo app, which allows the user to load and display JSON files in hierarchal format.

More details on the JSON format can be found at http://www.json.org

Download for the binary of the JSON Tree developer tool is available at:
